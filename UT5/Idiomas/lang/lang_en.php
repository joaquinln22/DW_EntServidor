Once this is done, no later than 24 hours, a more detailed questionnaire will be sent to your security officer, wich will provide us with more information so we can make a good audit for you.  Having done these two previous tasks, you will only have to wait until our experts complete the auditing process and give you a detailed report about the state of your organization regarding current legislation.",

This testing will be performed with the support of the staff of the organization, that will help the auditor in his task. This testing is simple, because it will be enough to choose those requisites from the SIREN PDP catalogue that are applicable in the audited organization and verify if they are fulfilled or not in the organization's software system. For example, if a certain organization is required to maintain a high protection level on its stored data, the auditor will extract from the catalogue those requisites necessary to reach this protection level and check if those requisites will be fulfilled by the organization. For this goal, the &quot;Audit companies&quot; tab will be used (we will use AuditSRSP and AuditSyRSP in case of auditing an Information System, and only AuditSRSP in case of auditing a software tool). In this activity we will keep in mind that if there exists a previous auditing report, we will pay more attention to the verification of those issues that were not accomplished in the previous audit.

"Iasms24"=>"The AuditSyTS and AuditSTS documents from the SIREN PDP cateloguye will be used to perform these tests.
